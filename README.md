# Hostel Management System
Our project is a Hostel Management System developed using Qt Creator with C++. This system is designed to help the hostel warden and administration manage hostel activities in a simple and efficient way. It reduces manual work and saves time by maintaining student records, meal menus, and complaints in digital form.
1.Introduction
The system has two main panels: 
Admin and User:
The Admin panel allows the admin to sign up and log in.
 After login, the admin can add students ,  delete students, update the hostel meal menu, view student complaints, and log out.The User panel allows students to log in, view the updated meal menu, submit complaints, and log out.
